1. Make sure that the UDP Server address of 192.168.1.190:12000 will work on your network.
	If not then modify the server address in the sketch to one that will.

2. Compile and Upload UDPEchoServer from MPIDE. 

3. Once UDPEchoServer is started; open the serial monitor at 9600 baud. You should see something like:

	UDPEchoServer 1.0
	Digilent, Copyright 2011

	Started Listening
	Listening on port: 12000

3. Under the PCCode directory start UDPEchoClient.exe; this is a windows Forms application so a window will automatically open.

4. In UDPEchoClient it defaults to the same hostname IP and port as the sketch was originally coded to. However, if you changed those values, change them in UDPEchoClient before proceeding.

5. The default "Send Text" in UDPEchoClient is "Text to Echo", you may leave this as is, or change it. This documentation is assuming you left it as is.

6. The Log in UDPEchoClient should look something like:

	UDPEchoClient Version 1.0.4373.28492
	Digilent, Copyright 2011

7. Click the Send button in UDPEchoClient and wait about 10 seconds. You should see in the serial monitor something like:

	UDPEchoServer 1.0
	Digilent, Copyright 2011

	Started Listening
	Listening on port: 12000
	Got 1 clients pending
	Got a Connection
	Got 12 bytes
	Writing datagram: 
	Text to Echo
	Closing UdpClient

	Listening on port: 12000

8. And in the UDPEchoClient you should see somethink like:

	UDPEchoClient Version 1.0.4373.28492
	Digilent, Copyright 2011
	Info: Please wait, attempting to resolve remote endpoint: 192.168.1.190:12000
	TX: Text to Echo
	Starting to listen
	RX: Text to Echo
	Ending listening

9. If you hit the Send button repeatedly quickly (within a second or so; actually less than 5 seconds).  You will see a repetition of the TX and RX without Start/End listening as the connection is not dropped between sends.

10. To close UDPEchoClient, hit the RED X.
