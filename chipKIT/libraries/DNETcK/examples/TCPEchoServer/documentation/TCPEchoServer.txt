1. Make sure that the TCP Server address of 192.168.1.190:11000 will work on your network.
	If not then modify the server address in the sketch to one that will.

2. Compile and Upload TCPEchoServer from MPIDE. 

3. Once TCPEchoServer is started; open the serial monitor at 9600 baud. You should see something like:

	TCPEchoServer 1.0
	Digilent, Copyright 2011

	Started Listening
	Listening on port: 11000

3. Under the PCCode directory start TCPEchoClient.exe; this is a windows Forms application so a window will automatically open.

4. In TCPEchoClient it defaults to the same hostname IP and port as the sketch was originally coded to. However, if you changed those values, change them in TCPEchoClient before proceeding.

5. The default "Send Text" in TCPEchoClient is "Text to Echo", you may leave this as is, or change it. This documentation is assuming you left it as is.

6. The Log in TCPEchoClient should look something like:

	TCPEchoClient Version 1.0.4373.28461
	Digilent, Copyright 2011


7. Click the Send button in TCPEchoClient and wait about 10 seconds. You should see in the serial monitor something like:

	TCPEchoServer 1.0
	Digilent, Copyright 2011

	Started Listening
	Listening on port: 11000
	Got 1 clients pending
	Got a Connection
	Got 12 bytes
	Writing: 
	Text to Echo
	Closing TcpClient

	Listening on port: 11000 

8. And in the TCPEchoClient you should see somethink like:

	TCPEchoClient Version 1.0.4373.28461
	Digilent, Copyright 2011
	Info: Please wait, attempting to connect to: 192.168.1.190:11000
	TX: Text to Echo
	Starting to listen
	RX: Text to Echo
	Ending listening

9. If you hit the Send button repeatedly quickly (within a second or so; actually less than 5 seconds).  You will see a repetition of the TX and RX without Start/End listening as the connection is not dropped between sends. Likewise in the serial monitor you will not see the Listening on port: 11000 between the echoes as that connection is not dropped either. 

10. To close TCPEchoClient, hit the RED X.
