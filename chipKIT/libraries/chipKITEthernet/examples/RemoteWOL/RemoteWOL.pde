/*	other computers are sleeping and you would like to remotely	*/

/*	This application can listen on a port for a TCIP request to send*/
/*	a WOL broadcast message and wake the sleeping computer.		*/
/*									*/
/*	RemoteWOL will wait and listen on the specified port		*/
/*	and when a MAC address is sent to it, it will re-broadcast	*/
/*	that MAC as a WOL Magic Packet on the local subnet to wake up	*/

/*	see your computer documentation or search online for Wake-On-LAN*/
