KELP is an LED based Aquatic Light Sculpture.

KELP is 8' by 8' wide and 6' tall; and composed of 64 individually
floating "strands".

Each strand contains 16 low voltage (5 VDC) water proof addressable
RGB LEDs, incased in air filled (for floatation) sealed plastic
sleaves with a cloth covering.

Mechanically, 8 Strands are attached to a 1" PVC pipe to compose a
'panel'. There are 8 panels connected with additional PVC spacers.

The piece has positive buoyancy, so will be held to the bottom of the
pool using waterproof sandbags designed for usage in pools.

Power will be provided by on "onshore" solar charged battery, located
up to 40' away from the piece, connected by light gauge cables that
will be placed in a "Yellow Jacket" cable tray. All LEDs and Control
electronics operate on 5VDC and are ground isolated.
